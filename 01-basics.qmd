    -   Comes with 3 quizzes that you can do at home - one quiz after each session, except for the last one.

    -   Don't be afraid to ask for help! We are all here to learn
:::

## About the workshop

-  Live coding & lots of hands-on

-  Take-home quiz after session 1, 2, and 3 to reinforce the learning - Link will be put on the course website.

-  Only for session 4: a small group activity at the second half of the session.

    -  Choose an economic indicator from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) e.g. Civilian Unemployment Rate.
    
    -  Apply your Python knowledge to create a "storyboard" with visualizations to derive your economic outlook. 


## Overview for today

-   Introduction to Visual Studio

-   Introduction to Python - objects, values, and types

-   Handling Lists

-   Handling Loops and Conditionals

## Why Python?

Q: What is Python, actually?

A: Python is a general-purpose programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Website, games, CAD applications, web applications, AI, etc.

Q: Why should I learn Python?

A: It’s one of the most popular programming language and the most dominant language in AI, ML, and data analytics field. It's a useful skill to know if you plan to go into those fields or anything adjacent.

## How do you run python?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If it's a **.py** file...

-   A regular python file.

-   A plain text and contains just python codes

-   Can be edited and run on Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, SPyder, etc or the terminal/command prompt.

# Getting Started: VS Code Workspace and Tour

## (Suggested) structure of workspace directory

1.  In your laptop, navigate to where you usually keep your files, and create a folder called `2024-09-python-workshop`. This folder will be our "workspace" where we keep our scripts and data files.

2.  Inside your workspace folder, create the following sub-folders:

    -   `data` - we will save our raw data here. **It's best practice to keep the data here untouched.**

    -   `data-output` - if we need to modify raw data, store the modified version here.

    -   `fig-output` - we will save all the graphics we created here!

3.  Start VS Code.

4.  Go to `File` \> `Open Folder`.

5.  Open the `2024-09-python-workshop` folder we just created.

## Best practice: Virtual Environment {.nostretch}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Virtual environment helps us to ensure that any packages we install will be isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter. This helps prevent issues that can occur due to conflicting package versions - especially useful for reproducibility!
:::

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows - `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Macbook).

2.  Type **Python: Create Environment**, and select the command. Choose `Venv`.

![](images/create_environment_dropdown.png){width="50%"}

3.  Select the Python interpreter that we installed in the pre-workshop activity. Give VS Code a few minutes to setup the environment.

![](images/interpreters-list.png){width="50%"}

## Create new file

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows - `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Macbook).

2.  Type **Python: New Python File**, and select the command.

3.  Rename the file to `01-intro.py`

## Some basic glossary (for your reference) {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Objects

:   In Python, everything is an object. An object is a piece of data that can have attributes and methods associated with it.

Value

:   The actual data stored in a variable or object. It can be a number, string, list, or any other data type.

Variable

:   A value that has a name associated with it.

Assign

:   To give a value to a variable. This is done using the equals sign (=).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Function

:   A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs (arguments) and return outputs.

Call

:   To execute or run a function. This is done by using the function name followed by parentheses.

Arguments

:   Values passed to a function when it is called. These values are used by the function to perform its task.

Options/Parameters

:   Variables defined in a function's declaration that act as placeholders for arguments. They specify what kind of data the function expects to receive.

Packages

:   Collections of related modules that extend Python's capabilities. They can be installed and imported to add new functionalities within your workspace.
:::

# Section 1: Getting Started

Hands on session - Make sure to open the `py` file we just created.

## Running your python code  {.nostretch}

Type the following in your `.py` file...

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
print("Hello World!")
5 + 5 
```

...and then click on the run button to run the script

![](images/py-run-button.jpg){width="40%"}

You should see "Hello World!" and a 10 printed at the Terminal window at the bottom

## Built-in functions

-  Functions will typically have brackets `()` at the end of their name.
-  Python has a built-in function called `print()` that prints things as text. 
-  Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(10 - 5)
print(10 * 2)
print("hello world")
```

## Comments 
Use comments to add a layer of documentation to your code. E.g., explain what a block of code does, etc.

Comments always start with a hashtag \#

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(10 - 5)
print(10 * 2)
print("hello world")
# print("python won't print this!")
```

Feel free to use this method to add your own notes throughout the workshop! 

# Section 2: Variables and assignment

## What's a variable?

Variables are names for values. \# In Python, the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left. 

Once you declare a variable, you must assign value to it.

```{python}
#| echo: true
greetings = "Hello World!"
age = 25
```

Variable names criteria:

- cannot start with a digit
- alphanumeric only (underscores are a-OK)
- case sensitive
- should be meaningful (e.g. `quarter1_growth` instead of just `q1g`)

## On creating variables
Variables must be created before they are used.

If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled, Python reports an error. e.g. if you try to simply declare a variable called `name` but didn't assign any value to it, Python will not like that and reports an error!

``` python
name  # This  will give you an error. 
```

## Things we can do with variables

We can pass variables to functions, e.g. let's pass the `greetings` variable to `print()` function. This should print out the value of `greetings`.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print(greetings)
print("today's greetings:", greetings)
```

We can also update the value contained inside a variable. Let's try adding 10 to variable `age`.
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
age = age + 10
print("Age in ten years from now:", age)
```

You can also assign a variable value to another variable

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
continent = "Asia"
position = continent  
print("Position:", position)  
print("Continent:", continent)  
```

## Learning Check #1

**What is the final value of variable `position` below?**

``` python
initial = "up"
position = initial
initial = "down"
```

**What is the final value of variable `country_1` below?**

``` python
country_1 = "Australia"
country_2 = "New Zealand"
temp = country_1
country_1 = country_2
country_2 = temp
```

# Section 3: Data Types and Conversion

## Refresher: Quantitative Data Types in Econs and Social Sciences

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Non-Continuous Data

-   Nominal/Categorical: Non-ordered, non-numerical data, used to represent qualitative attribute. e.g. Country, Employment status
-   Ordinal: Ordered non-numerical data. e.g. Nutri-grade ratings
-   Discrete: Numerical data that can only take specific value (usually integers) e.g. Shoe size, clothing size
-   Binary: Nominal data with only two possible outcome. e.g. pass/fail, yes/no, survive/not survive
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Continuous Data

-   Interval: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [It does not have a "true zero".]{.underline} e.g. Temperature of 0 C does not represent absence of heat.
-   Ratio: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [it has a "true zero".]{.underline} e.g. annual income of 0 represents no income.
:::
:::::

## Basic data types in Python

-   Integers (int): Whole numbers without a decimal point. Examples: 5, -3, 0
-   Floating-point numbers (float): Numbers with a decimal point. Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 2.0
-   Strings (str): Sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. Examples: "Hello", 'Python'
-   Booleans (bool): Logical values representing `True` or `False`. Examples: True, False
-   None: A special type representing the absence of a value

```{python}
#| echo: true
country = "Singapore"  # string
public_holidays = 11  # integer
avg_temp = 27.8  # float
part_of_asean = True  # Boolean
```
## Why do I need to care about these data types?

Because a value's data type determines what the program can do to it.

For example, the calculations below work on `int` data type

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print(public_holidays - 5)  
```

But the above operation won't work on a `string`
``` python
print(country - "pore") \# this will give an error!
```
However you can use "+" and "\*" on strings

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print(country + " best")  # this works for string, though.
print(country * 4)  # this also works
print("=" * 10)  # this also works
print(len(country))  # this would print out the number of characters a string has
```

## Converting data types to one another

Some data types need to be converted before we can do some operations on them i.e. this will give you an error.

``` python
print("10" + 2) 
```
Here is how you can convert the data types:

```{python}
#| echo: true
print("10" + str(2))  # convert to string
print(int(10) + 2)  # convert to int
```

## Take note of variables assignment placement

Take note of the execution order of your variables! They only change value when something is assigned to them.

```{python}
#| echo: true
public_holiday = 11  # initial value 
new_holidays = public_holiday + 5
public_holiday = 10  # we update the variable
print("Public holiday:", public_holiday) 
print("New holidays:", new_holidays) 
```

Updating the value of `public_holiday` will not auto-update the value of `new_holidays`.

## Learning Check #2

What is the data type of each of this variable?

``` python
a = 50  
b = "SMU Libraries"  
c = 100.5  
d = True  
e = 10 * 2.54  
f = int(5.5)  
g = 10 < 15  
h = len("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")  
```

# Section 4: Built-in Python functions

## Arguments vs Parameters

-   There are many built-in function that we can use, one of the common one is `round()` which will round a float number to the nearest integer.
-   Some functions accept arguments, and we put them inside the brackets when we pass it to the function. It's like telling the function "do what you're supposed to do with this things I pass to you".

```{python}
#| echo: true
round(3.14)
```

formal definition, but often used interchangeably: 

- arguments = the value passed to a function - in this case, 3.14 
- parameters = the variable passed to a function

## How do I find out more about a function?

-   Some functions can take more than one arguments! we've seen this with `print()` earlier.
-   If you're not sure what kind of arguments are accepted, etc, use the `help()` function. This example below should tell you more about `round()` once executed.

```{python}
#| echo: true
help(round)
```

# Section 5: Lists

## More data types / structure

Other than the basic 4 types that we learned earlier, Python has more data structures where we can store multiple values in a single variable:

-   **Lists**: Ordered, mutable (i.e. can be edited) sequences of elements. Examples: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`
-   **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable (i.e. cannot be edited once it is created) sequences of elements. Examples: `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b', 'c')`
-   **Dictionaries** (dict): Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Example: `{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`
-   **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements. Example: `{1, 2, 3}`

We will not be covering all of the above, only list and dictionaries (for session 4)

## When lists would be useful

Scenario: We want to track Singapore's GDP year-over-year (YoY) growth from 2024 to 2018.

-  A list helps us store multiple years of data in one place, making it efficient.
-  Without a list, we'd need dozens of separate variables for each year, making it harder to analyze trends.
-  Using a list, we can easily manage and analyze the data for all the years together.

```{python}
#| echo: true

# growth rates from 2023 Q1 to 2024 Q2
quarterly_gdp_growth = [-2,-5.8, 2.8, 2.6, 7.3, 1.1, 3.4]
```

You can also initialize an empty list to fill later

```{python} 
#| echo: true
future_growth_rates = []
```

## Check number of items in a list

As a good first step, it's good to check the number of items you have in your list!

```{python} 
#| echo: true
print('GDP growth rates:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
print('Number of quarters:', len(quarterly_gdp_growth))
```

## Retrieve a single item from a list

Sometimes you don't need the entire list. To retrieve a single value from a list, simply specify their index number enclosed in square brackets

-  Remember that index starts from 0 instead of 1.
-  So if you want to retrieve the fourth item (2021's growth rate), the index will be 3.

```{python} 
#| echo: true
print('GDP growth rate in 2023 Q1 (1st item):', quarterly_gdp_growth[0])
print('GDP growth rate in 2024 Q2 (6th item):', quarterly_gdp_growth[5])
```

If we put an index number that's larger than actual number of items, python will give us an error!

```python
quarterly_gdp_growth[10] # This would cause an IndexError
```

## Retrieve multiple items from a list: the syntax

Slicing allows you to extract a portion of the list by specifying a range of indices.
The basic syntax for slicing is:

``` python
list_name[start:end:step]
```

-  `start` is the index where the slice starts (inclusive)
-  `end` is the index where the slice ends (exclusive)
-  If `start` is omitted, the slice begins from the start of the list
-  If `end` is omitted, the slice goes to the end of the list
-  `step` is optional; it determines how many items to skip

## Retrieve multiple items from a list: in action

Specifying the start and end:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print('First three quarters:', 
quarterly_gdp_growth[0:3])
```

Omitting the end index:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print('From Q3 2023 onwards:', 
quarterly_gdp_growth[2:])
```

Omitting the start:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print('First three quarters:', 
quarterly_gdp_growth[:3])
```

If we put a negative index, python list will count from the end instead of the beginning!

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
print('Last three quarters:', 
quarterly_gdp_growth[-3:])
```

## Stepping value in a list

You can also use a step value to skip items! 

It is particularly useful if you need to reverse a list.

```{python}
#| echo: true

print('Every other quarter:', quarterly_gdp_growth[::2])
print('Quarters in reverse order:', quarterly_gdp_growth[::-1])

```

## Updating the value of items inside a list

List values can be replaced by simply assigning a new value to them! Let's update the growth rate for 2023 Q3 (index 2) with the correct figure.

```{python} 
#| echo: true
quarterly_gdp_growth[2] = -2.8
print('Updated GDP growth rates:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
```


## Appending items to a list

Let's append a new data of 3.2% growth that we get for 2024 Q3 to the list. Appending will put this new item at the end of the list. 

```{python} 
#| echo: true
print('GDP growth rates initially:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
quarterly_gdp_growth.append(3.2)  
print('GDP growth rates after adding 2024 Q3 prediction:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
```

## Adding data to a specific position in a list

Let's add data to the start of the list! The data is growth for 2022 Q4, which was 9.4%.

```{python} 
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
print('GDP growth rates initially:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
quarterly_gdp_growth.insert(0, 9.4) # <1>
print('GDP growth rates after adding 2022 Q4:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
```

1. The first parameter is the index position of where we want this new value to be. The second parameter is the actual value we'd like to insert. 

## Removing items from a list

Let's remove the two items we added previously! 

There are two ways to remove items: using `del` or `.pop()` method.

```{python} 
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2|3"
print('GDP growth rates initially:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
del quarterly_gdp_growth[0]  # <1>
quarterly_gdp_growth.pop()   # <2>
print('GDP growth rates after removing projection:', quarterly_gdp_growth)
```

1. with `del`, you need to specify the index of the items you'd like to remove
2. `pop()` will remove the item at the end of the list. 


## Calculations with List

Let's say we want to calculate the average quarterly gdp growth:

```{python} 
#| echo: true
total_growth = sum(quarterly_gdp_growth)
average_growth = total_growth / len(quarterly_gdp_growth)
print(f"Average quarterly GDP growth: {average_growth:.2f}%")
```

## Various data types in a single list

You can include values of different types in a list, though for GDP data we'll stick to numbers!

```{python} 
#| echo: true
mixed_data = ["2024 growth", 3.0, "2023 growth", 2.7]
print(mixed_data)
```

## Learning Check #3 {.scrollable}

Write a code to complete the following tasks:

1. Write a code to print the growth rate for 2023 Q4 (remember, it's the 5th item but index 4)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[4])
```

2. Write a code to print the growth rates for the first three quarters of 2023

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[0:3])
```

3. Add a projected growth rate of 3.3 and 3.6 the next two quarters at the end of the list

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
# method 1 using insert
quarterly_gdp_growth.insert(len(quarterly_gdp_growth), 3.3)

# method 2 using append
quarterly_gdp_growth.append(3.6)

print(quarterly_gdp_growth)
```

# Section 6: Loops

## Automate stuff with loop!

Scenario: We have Singapore's Quarterly GDP growth rates from 2023 Q1 to 2024 Q2, and we want to print them in this format: `Quarterly GDP growth: 5%`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Manually printing out the items

```{python}
#| echo: true

print("Quarterly GDP growth:", quarterly_gdp_growth[0], "%") 
print("Quarterly GDP growth:", quarterly_gdp_growth[1], "%") 
print("Quarterly GDP growth:", quarterly_gdp_growth[2], "%") 
print("Quarterly GDP growth:", quarterly_gdp_growth[3], "%") 
print("Quarterly GDP growth:", quarterly_gdp_growth[4], "%") 
# and so on...
# can you imagine doing this for 100++ items?
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
With `for` loop

```{python}
#| echo: true
for growth in quarterly_gdp_growth: 
    print("Quarterly GDP growth:", growth, "%") 
```
:::

::::

As you can see, we can achieve the same thing  (or more) with less code to type with `for` loop.

## Anatomy of a loop

Anatomy of loops explained using the example above:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
#| code-line-numbers: 1|2
for growth in quarterly_gdp_growth: # <1>
    print("Quarterly GDP growth:", growth, "%") #<2>
```

1.  `growth` is the loop variable, representing the value that changes with each iteration of the loop. You can think of it as the "current item" being processed. Meanwhile, `quarterly_gdp_growth` is the collection that the loop iterates over. The loop statement also ends with a colon `:`.
2.  `print("Quarterly GDP growth:", growth, "%")` is the body of the loop, specifying the action to take for each item in the collection. The body of the loop **must** be indented. 


## More examples: using `range()`

Below is a loop that will print out numbers from 1 to 6:

```{python} 
#| echo: true
for number in range(1, 7):  # 1 to 6, representing 6 quarters
    print("Quarter", number)
```

## More examples: using `enumerate()`

We can use `enumerate()` to loop not only the items inside a list, but also the index position of each item in the list!

Let's say we want to re-format our printout to `1) Quarterly GDP growth: 5%`

```{python}
#| echo: true

for index, item in enumerate(quarterly_gdp_growth):
    print(f"{index + 1}) Quarterly GDP growth: {item}%")

```


# Section 7: Conditionals (If-Else)

## Automate decisions with conditionals! {.scrollable}

Scenario: We have Singapore's Quarterly GDP growth rates, and we want to categorize them as "Growth", "Stable", or "Decline" based on their values.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Without conditionals and `for` loops
```{python}
#| echo: true

print(quarterly_gdp_growth[0], "% - Category: Decline")
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[1], "% - Category: Decline")
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[2], "% - Category: Decline")
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[3], "% - Category: Growth")
print(quarterly_gdp_growth[4], "% - Category: Growth")
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
With conditionals and `for` loops
```{python}
#| echo: true
for growth in quarterly_gdp_growth:
    if growth > 2:
        category = "Growth"
    elif -2 <= growth <= 2:
        category = "Stable"
    else:
        category = "Decline"
    
    print(f"{growth}% - Category: {category}")
```
:::

::::

## Why conditionals + for loops is great

1. Automated categorization based on values - no manual intervention needed!
2. Easily adjustable criteria (just change the numbers in the if-elif-else statements)
3. Works for any number of data points - again, no manual intervention needed!
4. Makes the code more readable and maintainable

Let's break down the anatomy of conditionals first!

## Anatomy of Conditionals

Also called if-else structure, it looks like this at the very basic level:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3|4|5|6"

gdp_growth = 2.5

if gdp_growth > 0: # <1>
    print("The economy is growing.") # <2>
else: # <3>
    print("The economy is not growing.") # <4>
```

1.  The if statement starts with the keyword 'if', followed by a condition, and ends with a colon ':'
2.  The body of the if statement is indented. This line of code will be run if the condition is fulfilled
3.  The else clause is optional, starts with 'else', and ends with a colon ':'
4.  The body of the else clause is also indented, and only run if the condition is NOT fulfilled

## Multiple conditions

Sometimes we have multiple conditions that we want to check! We can use `elif` (stands for else-if) to add the conditions. You can have multiple `elif` clauses. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "5,6"

gdp_growth = 0

if gdp_growth > 0:
    print("The economy is growing.")
elif gdp_growth == 0:
    print("The economy is stable.")
else:
    print("The economy is shrinking.")
```

## Multiple conditions with Boolean operators

In some cases, we can't split the conditions among multiple elifs. For example, we may want to check `gdp_growth` and `inflation` rate to determine the economic state.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4,5|6,7"

gdp_growth = 1.5
inflation = 2.0

if gdp_growth > 0 and inflation < 3: # <1>
    print("The economy is in a good state.")
elif gdp_growth > 0 or inflation < 3: # <2>
    print("The economy is in a mixed state.")
else:
    print("The economy needs attention.")
```

1. `and` requires both conditions to be `True`
2. `or` requires at least one condition to be `True`

## Multiple conditions - Order does matter!
Assuming variable `growth` has the value of 10, the conditionals below will give us the wrong result.

```{python}
#| echo: true
growth = 10
if growth > 0:
    print(f"{growth}% is a moderate growth")
elif growth > 5:  # This will never be reached for growth > 1
    print(f"{growth}% is a strong growth")
else:
    print(f"{growth}% is a negative growth")
```
This ordering would give the correct result:
```{python}
#| echo: true
if growth > 5:
    print(f"{growth}% is strong growth")
elif growth > 0:
    print(f"{growth}% is moderate growth")
else:
    print(f"{growth}% is negative growth")
```


## Nested conditionals

For a more complicated conditionals, you can put a conditional inside another! **Be careful with indentation to ensure correct nesting!**

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4,9,10|5-8"

gdp_growth = 2.5
unemployment = 4.0

if gdp_growth > 0: # <1>
    if unemployment < 5: # <2>
        print("Strong economic performance.") # <2>
    else: # <2>
        print("Growing economy, but high unemployment.") # <2>
else: # <1>
    print("Economic challenges ahead.") # <1>
```

1.  "outer" conditional.
2.  "inner" conditionals. Note the indent for this statement! This conditional will be run only if the outer conditions are fulfilled. 

## Conditionals and For loops combi

As seen from the first example of this section, we can combine for loops with conditionals

```{python}
#| echo: true

for growth in quarterly_gdp_growth:
    if growth > 2:
        category = "Growth"
    elif -2 <= growth <= 2:
        category = "Stable"
    else:
        category = "Decline"
    
    print(f"{growth}% - Category: {category}")
```

## Conditionals and For loops combi: counting occurence

Other ways for loops and conditionals can be used is for when we want to count occurence. Let's say we want to keep track how many growths and contractions have happened for the past quarters.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1,2|5-8"

growth_periods = 0 # <1>
decline_periods = 0 # <1>

for rate in quarterly_gdp_growth:
    if rate > 0:
        growth_periods += 1 # <2>
    elif rate < 0:
        decline_periods += 1 # <2>

print("Growth periods:", growth_periods)
print("Decline periods:", decline_periods)
```

1.  set the counters, one to keep track of growth and the other one to keep track of declines
2.  increase the counters when conditions were met.

## Learning Check #4

Write a script that identifies the highest and lowest growth quarters (5 mins)

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

# get the value of the highest and the lowest with max and min
highest_growth = max(quarterly_gdp_growth)
lowest_growth = min(quarterly_gdp_growth)
```
