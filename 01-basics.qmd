## Overview for today

-   Introduction to Visual Studio

-   Introduction to Python - objects, values, and types

-   Handling Lists

-   Handling Loops and Conditionals

## Why Python?

Q: What is Python, actually?

A: Python is a general-purpose programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Website, games, CAD applications, web applications, AI, etc.

Q: Why should I learn Python?

A: It’s one of the most popular programming language and the most dominant language in AI, ML, and data analytics field. It's a useful skill to know if you plan to go into those fields or anything adjacent.

## How do you run python?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If it's a **.py** file...

-   A regular python file.

-   A plain text and contains just python codes

-   Can be edited and run on Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, SPyder, etc or the terminal/command prompt.

# Getting Started: VS Code Workspace and Tour

## (Suggested) structure of workspace directory

1.  In your laptop, navigate to where you usually keep your files, and create a folder called `2024-09-python-workshop`. This folder will be our "workspace" where we keep our scripts and data files.

2.  Inside your workspace folder, create the following sub-folders:

    -   `data` - we will save our raw data here. **It's best practice to keep the data here untouched.**

    -   `data-output` - if we need to modify raw data, store the modified version here.

    -   `fig-output` - we will save all the graphics we created here!

3.  Start VS Code.

4.  Go to `File` \> `Open Folder`.

5.  Open the `2024-09-python-workshop` folder we just created.

## Best practice: Virtual Environment {.nostretch}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Virtual environment helps us to ensure that any packages we install will be isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter. This helps prevent issues that can occur due to conflicting package versions - especially useful for reproducibility!
:::

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows - `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Macbook).

2.  Type **Python: Create Environment**, and select the command. Choose `Venv`.

![](images/create_environment_dropdown.png){width="50%"}

3.  Select the Python interpreter that we installed in the pre-workshop activity. Give VS Code a few minutes to setup the environment.

![](images/interpreters-list.png){width="50%"}

## Create new file

1.  Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` on Windows - `Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` on Macbook).

2.  Type **Python: New Python File**, and select the command.

3.  Rename the file to `01-intro.py`

## Some basic glossary (for your reference) {.smaller}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Objects

:   In Python, everything is an object. An object is a piece of data that can have attributes and methods associated with it.

Value

:   The actual data stored in a variable or object. It can be a number, string, list, or any other data type.

Variable

:   A value that has a name associated with it.

Assign

:   To give a value to a variable. This is done using the equals sign (=).
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Function

:   A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs (arguments) and return outputs.

Call

:   To execute or run a function. This is done by using the function name followed by parentheses.

Arguments

:   Values passed to a function when it is called. These values are used by the function to perform its task.

Options/Parameters

:   Variables defined in a function's declaration that act as placeholders for arguments. They specify what kind of data the function expects to receive.

Packages

:   Collections of related modules that extend Python's capabilities. They can be installed and imported to add new functionalities within your workspace.

# Let's Code!

Hands on session - Make sure to open the `py` file we just created.

## Learning Check #1

### What is the final value of variable `position` below?

``` python
initial = "up"
position = initial
initial = "down"
```

### What is the final value of variable `country_1` below?

``` python
country_1 = "Australia"
country_2 = "New Zealand"
temp = country_1
country_1 = country_2
country_2 = temp
```

## Refresher: Quantitative Data Types

-   [**Non-Continuous Data**]{.underline}

    -   **Nominal/Categorical**: Non-ordered, non-numerical data, used to represent qualitative attribute.

        -   Example: nationality, neighborhood, employment status

    -   **Ordinal**: Ordered non-numerical data.

        -   Example: Nutri-grade ratings, frequency of exercise (daily, weekly, bi-weekly)

    -   **Discrete**: Numerical data that can only take specific value (usually integers)

        -   Example: Shoe size, clothing size

    -   **Binary**: Nominal data with only two possible outcome

        -   Example: pass/fail, yes/no, survive/not survive

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   [**Continuous Data**]{.underline}

    -   **Interval**: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [It does not have a "true zero".]{.underline}

        -   Example: Celsius scale. Temperature of 0 C does not represent absence of heat.

    -   **Ratio**: Numerical data that can take any value within a range. [it has a "true zero".]{.underline}

        -   Example: Annual income. annual income of 0 represents no income.

## Basic data types in Python

-   Integers (int)

    -   Whole numbers without a decimal point. Examples: 5, -3, 0

-   Floating-point numbers (float)

    -   Numbers with a decimal point. Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 2.0

-   Strings (str)

    -   Sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. Examples: "Hello", 'Python'

-   Booleans (bool)

    -   Logical values representing `True` or `False`. Examples: True, False

-   None

    -   A special type representing the absence of a value

## Learning Check #2

What is the data type of each of this variable?

``` python
a = 50  
b = "SMU Libraries"  
c = 100.5  
d = True  
e = 10 * 2.54  
f = int(5.5)  
g = 10 < 15  
h = len("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")  
```

## Python functions

-   There are many built-in function that we can use, one of the common one is `round()` which will round a float number to the nearest integer.

-   Some functions accept arguments, and we put them inside the brackets when we pass it to the function. It's like telling the function "do what you're supposed to do with this things I pass to you".

``` python
round(3.14)
```

formal definition, but often used interchangeably: - arguments = the value passed to a function - in this case, 3.14 - parameters = the variable passed to a function

-   Some functions can take more than one arguments! we've seen this with `print()` earlier

-   If you're not sure what kind of arguments are accepted, etc, use the `help()` function. This example below should tell you more about `round()` once executed

``` python
help(round)
```

## More data types

-   Lists

    -   Ordered, mutable sequences of elements. Examples: `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`

-   Tuples

    -   Ordered, immutable sequences of elements. Examples: `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b', 'c')`

-   Dictionaries (dict)

    -   Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Example: `{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}`

-   Sets

    -   Unordered collections of unique elements. Example: `{1, 2, 3}`

## Lists

Scenario: We want to keep track of Singapore's GDP year-over-year (YoY) growth rate from 2024 to 2018. 

-  Using a list allows us to store multiple years of data efficiently in a single variable. 

-  If we were saving each year's quarterly growth rate to separate variables, we would have dozens variables! 

-  This would make it difficult to perform calculations or analyze trends across years. 

-  A `list` will come in handy! List can store many values together in a single variable.

``` python
quarterly_gdp_growth = [-2,-5.8, 2.8, 2.6, 7.3, 1.1, 3.4]
```

## Learning Check #3

Write a code to complete the following tasks:

1.  Write a code to print the growth rate for 2023 Q4
2.  Write a code to print the growth rates for the first three quarters of 2023
3.  Add a projected growth rate of 3.3 and 3.6 for 2024 Q3 and Q4 respectively at the end of the list

## Loops

Scenario: We have Singapore's Quarterly GDP growth rates from 2023 Q1 to 2024 Q2.

-  We want to process this data efficiently and present it in a readable format - this is where a `For` Loop comes in handy!

-  Loop is useful for repetitive tasks. It also helps to keep your code succinct and easier to debug if there's an error

```python
for number in range(1, 7):  # 1 to 6, representing 6 quarters
    print("Quarter", number)
```

-  The above code is much shorter than typing `print` 6 times!

## Using list with For loop

Here is how you can use list in a For loop:

```python
for growth in quarterly_gdp_growth: # <1>
    print(f"Quarterly GDP growth: {growth}%") #<2>
```

Anatomy of loops explained using the example above:

1.  `growth` is the loop variable, representing the value that changes with each iteration of the loop. You can think of it as the "current item" being processed. Meanwhile, `quarterly_gdp_growth` is the collection that the loop iterates over.

2.  `print(f"Quarterly GDP growth: {growth}%")` is the body of the loop, specifying the action to take for each item in the collection.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

### Key things

- The first line of the for loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented.

- Indentation is always meaningful in Python. (the common convention is to indent with 4 spaces or tabs)

:::



## Conditionals (If-Else)

-  Conditionals or If-Else statements are used to control whether or not a block of code is executed.

-  The structure is similar to a For Loop:

    - First line opens with if and ends with a colon

    - Body containing one or more statements is indented

```python
if growth > 10:
    print("Strong economic growth!")
```

## Conditionals - Order does matter!
Assuming variable `growth` has the value of 10, the conditionals below will give us the wrong result.

```python
growth = 10
if growth > 0:
    print(f"{growth}% is a moderate growth")
elif growth > 5:  # This will never be reached for growth > 1
    print(f"{growth}% is a strong growth")
else:
    print(f"{growth}% is a negative growth")
```
This ordering would give the correct result:
```python
if growth > 5:
    print(f"{growth}% is strong growth")
elif growth > 0:
    print(f"{growth}% is moderate growth")
else:
    print(f"{growth}% is negative growth")
```

## Learning Check #4
